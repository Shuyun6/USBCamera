# USBCamera
Android USB camera, convert and stream via FFmpeg.

USBCamera class:

Load native library to convert media data format and stream video data by FFmpeg.

GLHepler class:

Initialized OpenGLES and EGL environment, methods for genarating texture„ÄÅshader and set up the FBO(Frame Buffer Object) to render media data.

CameraView class:

Get frame data and convert YUV to RGB through USBCamera, create a bitmap from RGB data then show by SurfaceHolder.(Low performance)

CameraRender class:

Create a texture with frame data that come from USBCamera, use OpenGLES to render texture to FBO then convert YUV to RGB in fragment shader(High performce)

PS:This project is do well in the Android Device without system camera module which attack USB camera, but it can find usb camera in some Android phone.
